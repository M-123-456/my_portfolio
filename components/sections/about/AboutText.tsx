            Hi, I am Miki and I came from Japan to Germany in 2009 to start a new stage of my life together with my husband. Since we became parents of one, two, three children,  
            After 12 years in a Japanese company in DÃ¼sseldorf, where I learned a lot about business, supply chain managemen, Excel, project management, reporting and the ups and downs of intercultural teams, I am currently reinventing myself. 
            
            Since early 2020, I&aposve been digging into the mysteries of development. What gets me out of bed in the morning is my will to constanly learn new things and grow personally. I am looking forward to working on exciting projects in an inspiring environment.
        </p>
